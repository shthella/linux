// check Is tty device created or not using below command
	ls /dev|grep ttyphani
// Write data to uart1 using below command
	echo -n "hi hello" > /dev/ttyphani2
//Read data from uart1 using below command
	cat /dev/ttyphani2
Note: when started reading, we have to give stop signal using ctrl+c because uart1 doesnot have any end of data it can arrive anytime
// when changing one baud rate to another baud rate using stty below command
	stty -F /dev/ttyphani2 9600
//check baud rate is changed or not using below command
	stty -F /dev/ttyphani2 -a
//Again, Write data to uart1 using below command
	echo -n "hi harsha" > /dev/ttyphani2
//Again, Read data from uart1 using below command
	cat /dev/ttyphani2 
//Again, changing baud rate to max 115200 using below command
	stty -F /dev/ttyphani2 115200
//Again, check baud rate is changed or not using below command
	stty -F /dev/ttyphani2 -a
//Again, Write data to uart1 using below command
	echo -n "hi harsha" > /dev/ttyphani2
//Again, Read data from uart1 using below command
	cat /dev/ttyphani2 
Note: while changing baud rate the min value should be 9600 and max value should be 115200 (this min and max i had set in uart driver code).
